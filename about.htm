   <p>Bodie Shanis started writing at age four, when he would dictate <i>Rugrats</i> fanfiction to his grandmother. At age eight, he self-published the picture book <i>Brownie and Piglet Go to the Mall</i>, a satire on the deliciously addictive nature of modern consumerism. At age sixteen, his short story “The King” won the June Avery Snyder Creative Writing Prize. Currently, he is working on a young adult novel about magic, mental illness, and the transgender experience.<br><br>

Bodie earned a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in English (and a minor in history) from Wesleyan University. His honors thesis was an exploration of masculinity’s role in Victorian popular fiction. Since then, he has worked as a freelance writer and editor in the Philadelphia area, writing for publications such as Bubbleblabber and Our Voice Magazine. As an editor, he has aided several novelists in improving and structuring their work.<br><br>

Bodie’s interests include medieval Italian literature, Roman history, LGBT rights, body positivity, and the Food Network. In his free time, he can be found wearing odd costumes, either because he’s at an anime convention or because he’s performing in a musical.<br><br>
